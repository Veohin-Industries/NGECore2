=== Radials! ===
All radial menus loaded inside the "scripts/radials" folder. Need to add a 
object.setAttachment('radial_filename', 'name_of_the_radial_script_py) 
to the objects actual script "scripts/object/...." in order for the radial menu to load. The radial
system tries to get an attachment to the object, therefore you must set one in the scripts, 
otherwise it will load default.py radial.

When wanting to reference text for a radial, you can use "@location_of_stf_file" for the string.
