=== Jython ====
actor & owner : CreatureObject


=== Radials! ===
All radial menus loaded inside the "scripts/radials" folder. Need to add a 
object.setAttachment('radial_filename', 'name_of_the_radial_script_py) 
to the objects actual script "scripts/object/...." in order for the radial menu to load. The radial
system tries to get an attachment to the object, therefore you must set one in the scripts, 
otherwise it will load default.py radial.

When wanting to reference text for a radial, you can use "@location_of_stf_file" for the string.

=== Scripting Notes ===
If there is a module that you want to use other than sys, you must find it inside
the Lib folder (ex you want to import random: C:\jython\Lib\random.py) and copy and paste it
into NGECore2\lib\Lib.
